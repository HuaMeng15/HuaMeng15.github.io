Hi! My name is Hua Meng (孟华). Nice to meet you!

I am a PhD student at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, advised by Prof. [Zili Meng](https://zilimeng.com/index.html). I earned my MSc from HKUST and my BSc from Nanjing University. After graduating in 2021, I spent nearly three years at Kuaishou, optimizing video and audio editing processes. Prior to that, I interned at Google and Microsoft, focusing on network and data center projects. My current research interests include real-time communication (RTC), VR communication, and network systems.

## Fun Facts About Me

- My favorite part of research is writing and debugging code.
- Before 2024, I never thought I'd enter academia. I even made a [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1sh411y7b6/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=1f5238a048d1547f5fd03622041faeea) expressing my doubts because I love coding.
- After three years work in a big company, I wanted more flexibility to pursue my true interests, so I left and returned to academia.
- I love reading books, especially of detective fiction.
- Once I start a book, it's hard for me to put it down, so I can only read when I have free time :)
